# Everest - Kiki Delivery Service

![Kiki Delivery Service](./docs/kiki.jpg)

Welcome to Kiki Delivery Service! This project is created as part of Everest Engineering's interview process. This is a simple CLI application that allows you to create a delivery order, and outputs the costs of the order, the delivery time as well as the shipment plan.



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need either of the following to run this project:

- Node.js v18 or above OR
- Bun v1.0.2 or above

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.2. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime. However, you can also run this project using Node.js.

### Running using npm (Node.js)

```bash
npm install
npm start

> everest-kiki@1.0.0 start
> ts-node src/cli/kiki.ts

ðŸ§¹ Welcome to Kiki Delivery Service! ðŸ§¹

ðŸ§¹ Please tell us more about your order

? ðŸ§¾ Enter order base cost [baseCost]:
```

### Running using Bun

```bash
bun install
bun start
```

## Using the CLI

This project is a CLI application. After you start the application, you will be prompted to enter the order details. You can enter the following details:


```
âžœ kiki

ðŸ§¹ Welcome to Kiki Delivery Service! ðŸ§¹

ðŸ§¹ Please tell us more about your order

? ðŸ§¾ Enter order base cost [baseCost]:  100
? ðŸ§¾ Enter order packages count [packagesCount]:  5
? ðŸ“¦ Enter package 1 details [<id> <weight> <distance> [offerCode]]: PKG1 50 30 OFR001
? ðŸ“¦ Enter package 2 details [<id> <weight> <distance> [offerCode]]: PKG2 75 125 OFR008
? ðŸ“¦ Enter package 3 details [<id> <weight> <distance> [offerCode]]: PKG3 175 100 OFR003
? ðŸ“¦ Enter package 4 details [<id> <weight> <distance> [offerCode]]: PKG4 110 60 OFR002
? ðŸ“¦ Enter package 5 details [<id> <weight> <distance> [offerCode]]: PKG5 155 95 NA
? ðŸ›µ Enter vehicles count [vehiclesCount]:  2
? ðŸ›µ Enter vehicles max speed [vehiclesMaxSpeed]:  70
? ðŸ›µ Enter vehicles max weight [vehiclesMaxWeight]:  200
```

You will then be given a summary of your order details. If you wish to make changes to your order, you may start over by when prompted. 

After this, you will be shown a report of your order. This includes the total cost of the order, the delivery time as well as the shipment plan.

## Build

You can build this project to a single file using the following command:

```bash
npm run build 

// or 

bun build
```

This will create a single file `kiki.js` in the project folder. You can then run the file without TypeScript or Bun installed.

```bash
node kiki.js
```

## Installing as a global CLI tool

You can also install this project as a global CLI tool using the following command. This will add `kiki` as a command in your terminal. You can then run the command anywhere in your terminal.


```bash
npm link
kiki -h
